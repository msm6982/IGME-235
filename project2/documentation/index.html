    <h2>Orignal Proposal</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            I'm planning on creating some sort of basic Pokemon team builder using Pokeapi. There is a lot of different
            types of data that can be gathered from this API, ones that I'm partially interested in are methods that
            find
            Pokemon that can be found in a particular habitat, and data for the actual Pokemon themselves, which
            includes
            their sprite. So using this information I would want to create a basic user experience where a user can
            click
            one of three random habitats, and from that habitat the user can select one of three Pokemon that can be
            found
            in that habitat to be added to the user's current team. While the user is encountering Pokemon in different
            habitats or when the user's team reaches a maximum of six the user can view their team more closely and view
            specific attributes about their Pokemon, and from there the user can release all their caught Pokemon and
            start
            over if they choose to. This is my current scope but may down scale as I learn more about the API. The
            target
            audience will most likely be younger children or pokemon fans as that's the target audience for Pokemon
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Site Interative Design</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            For this assignment I wanted to create an experience that was more than just a database presenter of key
            terms, I wanted to make something more interactive.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
            That's when I discovered one of the endpoints had a list of generic habitats from those endpoints that would
            lead to lists of all possible pokemon found in said generic habitat. This feature of the API was a perfect
            fit for what I wanted to do for this project.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
            Programming the functionality of this site was fairly difficult as many of the endpoints had different
            information from one another, so it required some awkward parsing and data storage of information so that
            the experience would be cohesive and repeatable.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
            And despite my best efforts in factoring and parsing this information I felt like similare code had to be
            repeated as there were many idiosyncrasies that I had to take into account of so that the experience worked
            as intended.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
            Despite the struggles I'm proud of all the functionalities implemented into this site. Which Include:
            Displaying 3 random areas where the player can choose to 'enter' one of the 3, Wild pokemon 'spawning' in
            those areas which the player can catch and add to their team and it goes back to the area choice, a manual
            search where players can search as add specific pokemon to their team, a team display showcasing detailed
            information about each team member, and a release function where the user can clear their current team so
            they can catch more than six pokemon (like in the base games)
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
            Also because many functions require a lot of data to parse and load, it randomly seems like it take a while
            to fully execute some functionalities
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
            Based the CSS and HTML off of the GIF Finder Homework and past knowledge. And many of the site's functions
            and visuals are based on the pokemon games. I did resort to outside source (listed above) for a few minor
            problems but nothing too major
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
            Lastly, It took me forever to get my project in a certicable prototype state since I was having emece
            difficulties with the event handlers, partly due to my inexperience with Javascript and partially due to the
            strange elements of the api. I was able to eventually put my prototype up for critique albeit late and I did
            critique other group members in time. Once I overcame the challenges with the prototype the rest was
            relatively straightforward.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
            So considering the strengths and weaknesses of my project and comparing it to the grade rubric requirements
            I'd give myself around a mid A: 96, Not everything is perfect but what works works really well
        </li>
