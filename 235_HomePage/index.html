        <P>
            Hi I’m Miles Michell! I am a second-year Game Design and Development student studying at Rochester Institute of Technology. My hometown is New Orleans Louisiana. 
            My main interests include programming, gaming, and nature. My main goal has always been to keep working on projects that I am proud of contributing to. 
            From this class, I’m hoping to learn effective ways of displaying my work. 
            Thought my major at RIT I’ve had amazing opportunities to learn from and collaborate with my fellow peers and professors which have definitely honed my skills. 
            After graduation, I hope that I will be working as a software developer or a game designer within the gaming industry!
        </P>
