        </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Interative Design</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>I designed this game to have a very 'pick up and play' type of game feel. Where it is easy to pick the game
            up in a few seconds but may be challenging to aim for the higher scores, especially with the increased spawn
            rate and speed of the obstacles at higher score levels. So adderaring to this pick up and play concept I
            only included very simple controls and objectives
        </li>
        <li>
            I came up with the theme of this game when thinking about how some bats flap their wings so much while
            airborne that their movement almost seems unnatural or they are struggling to stay flying.
        </li>
        <li>
            So considering that, I took a spin on it where what if they did 'really' have struggles with flying and a
            natural nocturnal flying 'rival' to a bat is an owl, and I just kept building ideas entirely off of those
            concepts
        </li>
        <li>
            The gravity based flying gameplay was heavily based on Flappy Bird, Jetpack Joyride, Joust, and other games
            with that sort of movement. Code implementation of this mechanic was based on vehicle movement I learned and
            implemented in IGME 209.
        </li>
        <li>
            The collectable flies movement and implementation was based on the circles from circle blaster as I liked
            there random movement and thought their behavior would be good fit for an collectable insect
        </li>
        <li>
            I focused entirely on gameplay implementations and relied on open source assets for visuals and sounds so
            currently some art styles and theming many not match my visual theme in my original proposal of being tongue
            and cheek.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Known Errors</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            As I've said I've entirely relied on open source art for the project so far and because of that some of the
            character within the sprite sheets have a pretty large offset of dead space, meaning that hitboxes are a bit
            unfair rn because they are based on the size of an individual cell of a sprite sprite sheet
        </li>
        <li>
            I've had a bit of experience coding this type of gravity based movement but I am still familiarizing myself
            with it. One of the biggest challenges with this type of movement is actually balancing the values of
            movement. I tried to balance these values the best I can while maintaining the 'struggle to fly' game feel,
            but as of now rapid mashing of the spaceboard is still required for precise movement which can feel
            extremely uncomfortable for some.
        </li>
        <li>
            No matter what animation speed I set the bat's animations to, 'flapping' still appears as though it happens
            way too quickly. It's fitting since real life bats fly their wings fast, but it would probably be more
            visually interesting to see this animation more clearly.
        </li>
    </ul>
